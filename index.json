The row-sparsity $s$, dimension $p$ and number of tasks $T$ are allowed to grow with $n$. In the high-dimensional regime $p\\\\ggg n$, in order to leverage row-sparsity, the MT Lasso is considered.\nWe build upon the MT Lasso with a de-biasing scheme to correct for the bias induced by the penalty. This scheme requires the introduction of a new data-driven object, coined the interaction matrix, that captures effective correlations between noise vector and residuals on different tasks. This matrix is psd, of size $T\\\\times T$ and can be computed efficiently.\nThe interaction matrix lets us derive asymptotic normal and $\\\\chi^2\\_T$ results under Gaussian design and $\\\\frac{sT+s\\\\log(p/s)}{n}\\\\to0$ which corresponds to consistency in Frobenius norm. These asymptotic distribution results yield valid confidence intervals for single entries of $B^\\*$ and valid confidence ellipsoids for single rows of $B^\\*$, for both known and unknown design covariance $\\\\Sigma$. While previous proposals in grouped-variables regression require row-sparsity $s\\\\lesssim\\\\sqrt n$ up to constants depending on $T$ and logarithmic factors in $n,p$, the de-biasing scheme using the interaction matrix provides confidence intervals and $\\\\chi^2\\_T$ confidence ellipsoids under the conditions ${\\\\min(T^2,\\\\log^8p)}/{n}\\\\to 0$ and $$ \\\\frac{sT+s\\\\log(p/s)+\\\\|\\\\Sigma^{-1}e\\\\_j\\\\|\\\\_0\\\\log p}{n}\\\\to0, \\\\quad \\\\frac{\\\\min(s,\\\\|\\\\Sigma^{-1}e\\\\_j\\\\|\\\\_0)}{\\\\sqrt n} \\\\sqrt{[T+\\\\log(p/s)]\\\\log p}\\\\to 0, $$ allowing row-sparsity $s\\\\ggg\\\\sqrt n$ when $\\\\|\\\\Sigma^{-1}e\\_j\\\\|\\_0 \\\\sqrt T\\\\lll \\\\sqrt{n}$ up to logarithmic factors.","tags":[],"title":"Chi-square and normal inference in high-dimensional multi-task regression","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I am/was a Teaching Assistant for the following courses.\n2020-2021\n   Probability Theory (30 hours)\n   Applied Statistical Learning (6 hours)\n   Functional and Convex Analysis (27 hours)\n  2019-2020\n   Python for Data Scientists (12 hours)\nmaterial\n   Introduction to Python (6 hours)\nmaterial\n  ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"322dbaccf72a6d71f827fdb2866be935","permalink":"/teaching/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/","section":"","summary":"My TA duties","tags":null,"title":"Teaching","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Valeur absolue\nSuites\nTrigonométrie\nExponentielle\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f37ef44930b44696d6870a9e84d84830","permalink":"/tutoring/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tutoring/","section":"","summary":"Valeur absolue\nSuites\nTrigonométrie\nExponentielle","tags":null,"title":"Tutoring","type":"page"}]
